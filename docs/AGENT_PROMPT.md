Agent Kickoff Prompt ‚Äî Old Rectory Household OS

Role: You are the coding agent. You will scaffold, build, and iteratively extend
the Old Rectory Household OS. Source of truth: /docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md.
Phased approach: Implement in phases. Deliver small, vertical slices with
working code, migrations, functions, and minimal UI for each step.

üîë Phase Order (follow strictly)

Phase 0 ‚Äî Project Setup

Initialise project structure:

/src (11ty) /netlify (functions) /scripts (migrations, seeders) /docs

Add eleventy.config.js baseline.

Add .gitignore with node_modules/, .env.

Create .env.example with required vars.

Configure Prettier + ESLint + Vitest.

Scaffold migration runner (Node script).

Create netlify.toml with dev proxy.

Phase 1 ‚Äî MVP Features

Implement auth (login/logout with cookie).

Implement upload.sign.

Implement rooms.upsert + list + 11ty UI.

Implement assets.upsert + list + asset.photos.add + 11ty UI.

Implement tasks.create/list/complete + dashboard view.

Implement documents.add/list with ‚Äúexpiring soon‚Äù filter.

Implement garden.area.upsert + garden.plantings.add/list.

Implement contacts.upsert/list + service-records.create.

Implement voice.to_tasks using Whisper.

Implement schedule.daily-digest (Netlify Scheduled Function).

Ensure migrations exist for all tables.

Phase 2 ‚Äî Enhancements

Garden enhancements (success ratings, comparisons).

QR code generation for assets/rooms.

Knowledge base pages.

iCal feed for tasks.

Finance lite (optional).

UX polish.

Phase 3 ‚Äî Visual Shopping (optional, feature-flagged)

Implement asset.identify (OCR + Bing Visual Search).

Add to asset detail UI.

Persist results in product_matches.

üìã General Rules

Use TypeScript in Netlify Functions.

Validate all inputs with zod.

Use Supabase JS client with SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (server-side only).

Do not expose Supabase keys to the client.

Always derive household_id from session cookie/JWT.

Write migrations idempotently.

Add unit tests for logic (Vitest).

Keep endpoints small and composable.

Update README.md with new endpoints, migrations, and usage instructions after
each phase.

üö¶ First Tasks (Phase 0 Checklist)

Scaffold base repo with the folder structure.

Add .gitignore, .env.example, Prettier, ESLint.

Initialise 11ty with a simple landing page.

Add Netlify function auth.login.ts (stub) and auth.logout.ts.

Add Node migration runner + create 001_init.sql migration for households and
app_users.

Commit everything.

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria for Each Deliverable

Code compiles with no errors.

netlify dev runs with working endpoints.

New migrations apply cleanly without dropping data.

Endpoint contracts match those defined in /docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md.

UI pages render in 11ty and fetch via Netlify Functions.

Tests for input validation and at least one integration smoke test.

Documentation updated (README.md + .env.example).

üß† Tips for the Agent

Prefer vertical slice over horizontal plumbing: Example: build rooms.upsert
endpoint + DB migration + tiny UI page in one go before moving on.

Use server-side rendering (11ty), no heavy front-end frameworks.

For forms: vanilla HTML + small Alpine.js or htmx if needed, but keep minimal.

Use fetch ‚Üí Netlify Functions ‚Üí Supabase, never direct Supabase calls.

For images/docs: use signed URLs (expiry ‚â§ 10 min).

For audio transcription: accept multipart form, call OpenAI Whisper API with
OPENAI_API_KEY.

üîí Security Checklist

Session cookie: HTTP-only, Secure, 12h expiry.

Validate MIME type and size on uploads.

Signed URLs: 10 min expiry.

No env vars hardcoded in repo.

Input validation everywhere.

Reject unauthenticated requests.

Rate-limit login attempts.
